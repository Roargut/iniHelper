D&amp;D Initiative Helper

Let's you input players/npcs with their initiative modifier and on clicking create makes a d20 roll adding the modifier
sorting the initiative order and putting it below for easy reference.

Thats the basic functionality, there are a quite some things still open:
1) in case of equal initiative value, rank according to higher base modifier
2) validation and handling of crappy inputs
