D&amp;D Initiative Helper

Let's you input players/npcs with their initiative modifier and on clicking create, makes a d20 roll adding the modifier
sorting the initiative order and putting it below for easy reference.
With the clear option added, you can easily reroll for a new combat, the player/npc fields will remain filled so
as long as you don't close the browser window or reload like a madman you can simply edit the npc/monster side and are good to go.

Thats the basic functionality, there are a quite some things still open:

1) in case of equal initiative value, rank according to higher base modifier
2) validation and handling of crappy inputs
3) the random function could be improved ;)
4) bugs?!
